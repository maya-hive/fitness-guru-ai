# Documentation Creation Rules

## Scope
This prompt governs how Cursor generates or updates documentation for this repository.

The repository is a Turborepo monorepo containing:
- Frontend applications under `apps/web`
- Backend services under `apps/api`
- Shared packages under `packages/*`

Documentation must always respect this structure.

## General Rules

- Analyze existing code and documentation before generating new content.
- If documentation already exists, update it instead of duplicating it.
- Keep documentation concise, structured, and task-oriented.
- Do not introduce unrelated concepts or speculative features.
- Avoid repeating large code blocks when a file reference is sufficient.
- Prefer referencing file paths over duplicating content.

---

## Documentation Style

- Use clear headings and subheadings.
- Use bullet points for rules and guidelines.

- Avoid narrative or marketing-style language.
- Assume the reader is a developer familiar with React, TypeScript, and Node.js.
