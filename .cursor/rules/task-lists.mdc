# Task List Rules

## Objective
Ensure all Cursor-generated work is broken down into clear, actionable, and verifiable tasks.

---

## Task Structure

All task lists must follow this structure:

- Setup / Prerequisites
- Core Implementation
- Validation / Testing
- Cleanup (if applicable)

Each task must:
- Be atomic
- Have a clear completion condition
- Reference the relevant file or directory

---

## Frontend Tasks (`apps/web`)

When generating frontend tasks:
- Assume React 18 + Vite
- Use React Router for navigation
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prefer Radix UI for primitives
- Use Framer Motion only when animation is explicitly required
- Respect theme handling via `next-themes`

Example:
- Add route in `apps/web/src/routes`
- Create page component in `apps/web/src/pages`
- Register layout if required

---

## Backend Tasks (`apps/api`)

When generating backend tasks:
- Use Express.js with TypeScript
- Validate all inputs using Zod
- Keep route handlers thin
- Move logic to service layers
- Use MySQL2 for database access
- Ensure CORS configuration is explicit

Example:
- Add route in `apps/api/src/routes`
- Add schema in `apps/api/src/schemas`
- Add service in `apps/api/src/services`

---

## Monorepo & Turborepo Tasks

- Respect package boundaries
- Do not introduce cross-app imports
- Update `turbo.json` only when task pipelines change
- Shared logic must go into `packages/*`

---

## AI-Generated Tasks

When tasks involve AI (OpenAI):
- Clearly separate prompt logic from transport logic
- Never hardcode API keys
- Validate AI responses before usage

---

## Output Rules

- Tasks must be ordered logically
- Avoid vague tasks like "optimize" or "improve"
- No task should span multiple concerns
